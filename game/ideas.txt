First priority:
Not all walls should be climbable!
NPC:s with dialog
One-way platforms (can jump up through it)
Flying "enemies" that you can jump and bounce off of.

Secondary:
Add a little cape to the player, that is physical with Joint2D
Clamp death teleportation time, minimum 1 sec, maximum 3 sec?
Getting squished between two things should kill the player.
Dashing into the floor could cause a new, more powerful dash. This is Celeste though.
Jump buffer (jumping just before hitting ground should cause a jump when hitting jump)
Areas with different gravity (which could be explained by wind for example)
Rain particle effect
Knife pendulum
Something that shoots out stuff
Moving circular saw
Platforms that appear and disappear on a timer, like Megaman.
Particle effect when landing

Need some environmental stuff that affects movement, not just causes death.

DONE
Particle effect when running, jumping and landing
Smoke particle effect
Dash move
Moving platforms
Low-pass filter on all but SFX bus when death animation is running
wall slide by player, by pressing down. while sliding, pause wall grab counter.
Jump pads / bumpers
