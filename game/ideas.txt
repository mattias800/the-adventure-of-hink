# First priority
TileMapLayer with no collision, that becomes opaque when player is behind/over it.
Tutorial levels should be easier.
Make tutorial levels circular, so the player doesn't have to go back.
Water sound should trigger from sample 0 first time, then random 5000-10000 sample.

# Puzzle ideas
Navigate the boomerang by using teleports. Player enters teleports to make the boomerang follow it.
Jump pads that are activated by triggers.
- Simple, just throw the boomerang, fly away.
- Harder, boomerang must hit switch in the way back.
- Hardest, boomerang must go back in certain direction.

# Level element ideas:
Boundaries (such as laser) that kills you unless you dash through it. Forces the player to spend a dash.

# Boomerang ideas:

Push boomerang, can push things
Pull boomerang, can pull things
Freeze boomerang, can create ice blocks on water
Cling boomerang, can be walked on after it gets stuck
Hookshot boomerang, what it sounds like :)
Bounce boomerang, bounces on surfaces.
Maybe single use boomerangs, that can be used mid-air when collected, like Celeste extra jumps.
Railing that player can hang from and ride with the boomerang.

# Secondary
Objects that can be pushed
Surfaces that the boomerang bounce off of and get redirected.
Floor with spikes that appear 1 sec after player steps on it
Add a little cape to the player, that is physical with Joint2D
Dashing into the floor could cause a new, more powerful dash. This is Celeste though.
Jump buffer (jumping just before hitting ground should cause a jump when hitting jump)
Areas with different gravity (which could be explained by wind for example)
Rain particle effect
Knife pendulum
Something that shoots out stuff
Moving circular saw
Platforms that appear and disappear on a timer, like Megaman.

Need some environmental stuff that affects movement, not just causes death.

DONE
Cutscene!
Try add a chain with joint2d?
Not all walls should be climbable! Do this with separate tilemap!
Chest that can be opened, with nice animation when you receive the item/skill.
Add sounds to boomerang
Boomerang!
Particle effect when jumping, double jumping and landing
Add raycast that is smaller than collision, if distance=0 in both x-directions, player was squashed!
Getting squished between two things should kill the player.
Particle effect when running, jumping and landing
Smoke particle effect
Dash move
Moving platforms
Low-pass filter on all but SFX bus when death animation is running
wall slide by player, by pressing down. while sliding, pause wall grab counter.
Jump pads / bumpers
NPC:s with dialog
Clamp death teleportation time, minimum 1 sec, maximum 3 sec?
Flying "enemies" that you can jump and bounce off of.
Need to separate coyote time from ground and from wall.
One-way platforms (can jump up through it)
